# GreyGoo - world domination, one byte at a time

Mad roboticist simulator - convert everything in sight to magnificent robot-kind!

A strategy game for the patient. Design and build up your robot army. Run trials with your robots, aiming to EAT ALL THE STUFF. The game plays out in pseudo real-time. In a normal RTS game, researching a new technology will, understandably, take several in-game months or even in-game years but in real life, only minutes pass. In GreyGoo, researching a new technology takes hours, perhaps days. Running a test run of your robot menace may take minutes, hours or even days of real-time.

Set off your plans, and check your progress, and take over the world!
